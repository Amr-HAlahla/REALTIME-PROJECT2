## Overview

The simulation involves multiple processes that represent different entities in the aid distribution chain, including cargo planes, collectors, distributors, and families. The system uses shared memory and semaphores for inter-process communication and synchronization.

## Features

- **Multi-Process Simulation**: Models various entities involved in aid distribution.
- **Shared Memory and Semaphores**: Utilizes POSIX shared memory and semaphores for efficient data sharing and synchronization.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows customization of simulation parameters through a configuration file.
- **Hostile Interference Simulation**: Includes occupation forces that attempt to disrupt the operation.
- **Monitoring and Safety**: Tracks container status, worker energy, and family starvation levels.

## Configuration

The simulation is configured using the `configuration.txt` file, which includes parameters such as:

- Number of cargo planes and containers
- Drop frequencies and refill periods
- Number of committees and workers
- Worker energy levels and capacities
- Various thresholds for simulation conditions

## Components

- **parent.c**: Main process that orchestrates the simulation.
- **cargoPlane.c**: Simulates cargo planes dropping aid containers.
- **collectorsCommittee.c**: Manages groups of workers collecting containers.
- **distributers.c**: Handles distribution of aid to families.
- **families.c**: Represents families receiving aid.
- **monitor.c**: Monitors container status and movement.
- **splitter.c**: Splits containers into smaller bags.
- **occupationForces.c**: Simulates hostile forces.

## üîß Configuration

The simulation behavior is driven by the `configuration.txt` file. It allows setting:

- Number of:
  - Cargo planes
  - Containers per drop
  - Collector and distributor committees
  - Workers per committee
- Container drop frequency and plane refill periods
- Worker energy levels, consumption rates, and recovery time
- Starvation thresholds and monitoring intervals
- Simulation timeout

Example snippet from `configuration.txt`:

cargo_planes=3 containers_per_drop=10 drop_frequency=5 collectors_committees=2 splitters=4 distributors=2 families=10 monitor_interval=3 max_starvation_level=5 simulation_duration=120
